## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-planning]: Fix via SSH from 105 — single Claude Code session manages both servers
- [Pre-planning]: Full ads API integration — Mike needs conversational campaign control for active campaigns
- [Pre-planning]: Fix CRM before building new — reliability of existing tools before new features

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4 prerequisite]: Verify Google Ads developer token approval level before writing budget mutations — sandbox-only token will silently fail against production accounts
- [Phase 5 prerequisite]: Confirm whether current Meta access token in .env is System User (non-expiring) or personal user token before Phase 5
- [Phase 2 decision]: During Phase 2 execution, decide whether to unarchive OpenAI project or switch Claw to Ollama nomic-embed-text for embeddings
